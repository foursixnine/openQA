== Needle editing

- If a new needle is created based on a failed test, the new needle
  will not be listed in old tests.
- If an existing needle is updated with a new image or different
  areas, the old test will display the new needle which might be
  confusing
- If a needle is deleted, old tests may display an error when viewing
  them in the web UI.

== Mixed production and Development environment

There are few things to take into account when running a development version and
a packaged version of openqa:

If the setup for the development scenario involves sharing /var/lib/openqa,
it would be wise to have a shared group _openqa_, that will have write and execute
permissions over said directory, so that _geekotest_ user and the normal development
user can share the environment without problems.

This approach will lead to a problem when the openqa package is updated, since the
directory permissions will be changed again, nothing a chmod or chgrp can not fix.

[source,sh]
----
chmod -R g+rwx /var/lib/openqa
chgrp -R openqa /var/lib/openqa
